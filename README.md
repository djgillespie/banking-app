Bad Bank Application
This is a software application that works similarly to a banking application. The word "bad" represents the lack of security of this bank, but the point is to showcase the author's skills in programmatically applying functionality. This includes:

displaying a navigation bar using styles from Bootstrap
adding links to each navigation bar element
pages that allow a user to create an account, login, deposit, withdraw, view balance, and show all data
the account permanently reflecting the correct balance after the user deposits or withdraws
